prestashop-automation-tool
==========================

This tool is designed to make selenium testing of PrestaShop shops really easy. It should work with any non-windows OS, but the preferred configuration is a Linux machine with apache2.

#Setup

##Prerequisites

You will need a working ruby environment:

`sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev`

And probably the mysql headers for the mysql2 gem to compile:

`sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev`

##Installation

`sudo gem install prestashop-automation-tool`
